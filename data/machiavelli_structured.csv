1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,reference,NA,INTRODUCTION
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,Nicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"second son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,members of the old Florentine nobility.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"His life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,Florence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de’ Medici, Il Magnifico."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"The downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,Machiavelli entered the public service. During his official career
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"Florence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"until 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"office. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,were once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli’s
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"literary activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"weeks of the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"fifty-eighth year, without having regained office."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,reference,NA,YOUTH — Æt. 1-25—1469-94
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"Although there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,this representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"described as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"the fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,Lorenzo. Savonarola’s influence upon the young Machiavelli must have
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"been slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"fortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"gibe in The Prince, where he is cited as an example of an unarmed"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,prophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,rule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"strongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,Lorenzo’s grandson that he dedicates The Prince.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"Machiavelli, in his “History of Florence,” gives us a picture of the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,young men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: “They were freer
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"wit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"was thought the wisest.” In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"shows why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,leads us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes:
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"“I have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"especially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"which I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"share.” Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: “This will turn"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"out well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"you have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"and music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"have. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,you if you help yourself.”
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,reference,NA,OFFICE — Æt. 25-43—1494-1512
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,The second period of Machiavelli’s life was spent in the service of the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,serving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"Chancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,Peace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"Machiavelli’s life, for during this time he took a leading part in the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"affairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"dispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mere"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,recapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"soldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,supplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,which illustrate The Prince.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"His first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, “my lady of Forli”"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"of The Prince, from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"fortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,urged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,In 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"continuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"of affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"summarized in The Prince, and was consequently driven out. He, also,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,it was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,to Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,that such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,faith of princes.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,Machiavelli’s public life was largely occupied with events arising out
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of The"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,Prince. Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,for the benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"seized; he can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"pattern of Cesare Borgia’s conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,by some critics as the “hero” of The Prince. Yet in The Prince the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,duke is in point of fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"fortune of others, and falls with them; who takes every course that"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,might be expected from a prudent man but the course which will save
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,him; who is prepared for all eventualities but the one which happens;
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"and who, when all his abilities fail to carry him through, exclaims"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"that it was not his fault, but an extraordinary and unforeseen"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,fatality.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"On the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"watch the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,cheated into allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"delle Rovere (Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"reason to fear the duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,says that he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,forget old injuries deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,ruined Cesare.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"It was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,pontiff was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"to a successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,chiefly to his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,that Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,"women, and concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,that will win and hold them both.

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,with results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,introduction,content,NA,already been alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,36,an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,51,"For these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,53,only needed Lodovico’s own forces; because those who had opened the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,57,"they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,64,defeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,86,"only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,87,"their former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,88,"nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,89,become entirely one body with the old principality.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,90,"But when states are acquired in a country differing in language,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,91,"customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,92,"energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,93,helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,94,"there. This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,95,"made that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,96,"measures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,97,"there, would not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,98,"spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,99,"them; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,100,"great, and then one can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,101,country is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,102,"by prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,103,"more cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,104,who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,105,caution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,106,from him with the greatest difficulty.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,107,"The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,108,"which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,109,this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,110,"prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,111,"he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,112,only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,113,"to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,114,"scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,115,"uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,116,to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,117,"been despoiled. In conclusion, I say that these colonies are not"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,118,"costly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,119,"has been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,120,"has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,121,"because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,122,ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,123,ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,124,But in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,125,"more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,126,"so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,127,"exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,128,"of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,129,"all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,130,"own ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,131,guards are as useless as a colony is useful.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,132,"Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,133,ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,134,"neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,135,"that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,136,footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,137,"introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,138,"ambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,139,brought into Greece by the Ætolians; and in every other country where
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,140,they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,141,"the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,142,"enters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,143,hatred which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,144,those subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,145,"to himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,146,has acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,147,"of too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,148,"and with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,149,"them, so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,150,"not properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,151,and whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,152,troubles.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,153,"The Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,154,measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with[2]
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,155,"the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,156,"greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,157,Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,158,"Ætolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,159,"humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,160,"Ætolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,161,did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,162,"without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,163,them agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,164,"the Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,165,"who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,166,"which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,167,"is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,168,medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable;
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,169,"for it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,170,"fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,171,"difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,172,"detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,173,"difficult to cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,174,evils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,175,"man to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,176,"having been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,177,"every one can see them, there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,178,"Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,179,"avoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,180,"is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,181,others; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,182,Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,183,"both, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,184,is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:—Let us enjoy the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,185,benefits of the time—but rather the benefits of their own valour and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,186,"prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,187,"with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,188, [2] See remark in the introduction on the word “intrattenere.”
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,189,But let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,190,things mentioned. I will speak of Louis[3] (and not of Charles)[4] as
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,191,"the one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,192,possession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,193,has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,194,a state composed of divers elements.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,195," [3] Louis XII, King of France, “The Father of the People,” born 1462,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,196, died 1515.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,197," [4] Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,198,"King Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,199,desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,200,"will not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,201,"foothold in Italy, and having no friends there—seeing rather that every"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,202,door was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles—he was forced to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,203,"accept those friendships which he could get, and he would have"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,204,succeeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,205,"made some mistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,206,regained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded;
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,207,"the Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,208,"Ferrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,210,the Sienese—everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,211,"could the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,212,"which, in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,213,the king master of two-thirds of Italy.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,214,Let any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,215,have maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,216,"laid down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,217,"they were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,218,"Church, some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,219,"forced to stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,220,made himself secure against those who remained powerful. But he was no
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,221,sooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,222,occupy the Romagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,223,"weakening himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,224,"thrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,225,"adding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,226,"authority. And having committed this prime error, he was obliged to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,227,"follow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,228,"Alexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,229,himself forced to come into Italy.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,230,"And as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,231,"deprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,232,"divided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,233,"in Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,234,and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,235,"whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,236,"drove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,237,in turn.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,238,"The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,239,"do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,240,"when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,241,"folly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,242,"her own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,243,ought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,244,the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,245,"got a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,246,not the excuse of that necessity.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,247,"Therefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,248,"he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,249,"brought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,250,"not send colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,251,injure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,252,"the Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,253,"Spain into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,254,"humble them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,255,"consented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,298,I answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,299,"be governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,300,"servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,301,"favour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,302,by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,303,"have states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,304,hold them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,305,"prince and his servants hold their prince in more consideration,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,306,because in all the country there is no one who is recognized as
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,307,"superior to him, and if they yield obedience to another they do it as"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,308,"to a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,310,The examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,311,King of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,312,"lord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,313,"sanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,314,changes them as he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,316,"and beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,317,"take these away except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,318,of these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,319,"of the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,320,causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,321,"the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,322,he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,323,lord has around him. This arises from the reasons given above; for his
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,324,"ministers, being all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,325,"great difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,326,"they have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the people with them,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,327,"for the reasons assigned. Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,328,"mind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,329,"own strength than on the revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,330,"been conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,331,"replace his armies, there is nothing to fear but the family of this"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,333,others having no credit with the people; and as the conqueror did not
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,334,"rely on them before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,335,"The contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,338,"for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,339,"victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,341,those you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,342,"the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,346,Now if you will consider what was the nature of the government of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,347,"Darius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,348,"therefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,350,"victory, Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,351,for the above reasons. And if his successors had been united they would
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,352,"have enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,354,But it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,355,like that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,425,these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,426,"Nevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,427,"strongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,428,"other state, is compelled to reside there in person."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,429,"But to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,430,"have risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,431,and such like are the most excellent examples. And although one may not
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,432,"discuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,433,"he ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,434,to speak with God. But in considering Cyrus and others who have
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,435,"acquired or founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,436,"particular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,437,"found inferior to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,438,And in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,439,"anything to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,440,to mould into the form which seemed best to them. Without that
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,441,"opportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,442,without those powers the opportunity would have come in vain.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,443,"It was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,446,"bondage. It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,447,"that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,448,become King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. It was necessary
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,449,that Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the government of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,450,"the Medes, and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,451,Theseus could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,452,"dispersed. These opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,453,and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,454,whereby their country was ennobled and made famous.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,455,"Those who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,456,"principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease. The"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,457,difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,458,and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,459,government and its security. And it ought to be remembered that there
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,460,"is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,461,"more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,462,"introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,463,"enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,464,lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,465,"coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,466,"their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,467,believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,468,Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,469,"opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,470,"defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,472,"It is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,473,"thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,474,"or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,475,"their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? In"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,478,are rarely endangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,479,"conquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,480,"reasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,481,"is easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,482,"persuasion. And thus it is necessary to take such measures that, when"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,483,"they believe no longer, it may be possible to make them believe by"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,484,force.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,485,"If Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,486,have enforced their constitutions for long—as happened in our time to

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,490,unbelievers to believe. Therefore such as these have great difficulties

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,597,that undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,604,entirely to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,605,"Orsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,606,"to him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,608,called a meeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,612,"trusting either to the French or other outside forces, he had recourse"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,625,"masters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,626,"them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,627,"full of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,628,"to bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,629,necessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted Messer

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,631,power. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,632,greatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was not
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,633,"advisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,634,"that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,636,advocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused some

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,638,"people, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,657,Such was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,658,"he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,660,"Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,662,"to take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,664,"with their aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,665,"college more to himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,666,the Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,667,"shock. Of these four things, at the death of Alexander, he had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,668,accomplished three. For he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,669,"as he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,670,"Roman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the college. And"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,671,"as to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master of Tuscany,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,672,"for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, and Pisa was under his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,673,protection. And as he had no longer to study France (for the French
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,674,"were already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,675,"in this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill), he pounced down"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,677,hatred and partly through fear of the Florentines; and the Florentines

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,690,would have overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,691,"foundations were good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,692,"month. In Rome, although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,693,"the Baglioni, the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,694,could not effect anything against him. If he could not have made Pope

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,802,he entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,807,"lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,810,Fermo. When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,811,"in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,816,"chamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,817,him. No sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,818,"and slaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,819,"mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,820,"magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,822,"prince. He killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,823,"strengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,824,"way that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,825,"was he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,826,his neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,827,that of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,828,"Cesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,829,as was stated above. Thus one year after he had committed this
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,830,"parricide, he was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,831,his leader in valour and wickedness.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,832,"Some may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,833,"infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,837,"the state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I believe that this"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,838,follows from severities[2] being badly or properly used. Those may be
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,839,"called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,840,"applied at one blow and are necessary to one’s security, and that are"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,841,not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,842,"of the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,843,"they may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,844,"decrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,845,"or man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,846,impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,847, [2] Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the modern
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,848, equivalent of Machiavelli’s thought when he speaks of “crudelta” than
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,849, the more obvious “cruelties.”
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,850,"Hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,851,to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,853,repeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,854,"reassure them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,855,"otherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,856,"keep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,857,"can they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,858,"repeated wrongs. For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,859,"that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,860,"little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer."

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,reference,NA,CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,867,But coming to the other point—where a leading citizen becomes the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,868,"prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,869,but by the favour of his fellow citizens—this may be called a civil
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,870,principality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,871,"to it, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,872,principality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,873,favour of the nobles. Because in all cities these two distinct parties
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,874,"are found, and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,875,"ruled nor oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,876,oppress the people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,877,"cities one of three results, either a principality, self-government, or"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,878,anarchy.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,879,"A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,880,accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,881,"nobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,882,"reputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,883,"under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,884,"finding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,885,"one of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,886,authority. He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,887,maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,888,"aid of the people, because the former finds himself with many around"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,889,"him who consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,890,neither rule nor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,891,"sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has none around"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,892,"him, or few, who are not prepared to obey him."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,893,"Besides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,894,"satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,895,"more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,896,while the former only desire not to be oppressed. It is to be added
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,897,"also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,898,"because of there being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,899,"himself, as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,900,from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,901,"nobles he has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,902,"rise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,903,"astute, always come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,904,"favours from him whom they expect to prevail. Further, the prince is"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,905,"compelled to live always with the same people, but he can do well"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,906,"without the same nobles, being able to make and unmake them daily, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,907,to give or take away authority when it pleases him.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,908,"Therefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,909,"be looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,910,"their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,911,"they do not. Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,912,to be honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,913,with in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,914,"natural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,915,"especially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,916,"prosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,917,"But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,918,"is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,919,"and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,920,"were open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,921,"Therefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,922,"ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,923,"ask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition to the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,924,"people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,925,"everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,926,"easily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,927,"receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,928,closely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,929,devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,930,"favours; and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,931,"these vary according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,932,"so I omit them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,975,It is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,976,"these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,977,"case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,978,he has always need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,979,clear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,980,"their own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,981,a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,982,them; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,983,"show themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,984,defend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has been
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,985,"discussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,997,because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,998,"taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,999,"have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1001,"and firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1002,"to the state, they always have the means of giving work to the"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1004,and on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1005,"military exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1006,uphold them.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1007,"Therefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1014,self-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer that
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1015,a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1016,giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1018,himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1022,"prince to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1023,"damage is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1024,any remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1028,"confer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1029,"well considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1107,Having discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1108,"principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1109,"considered in some degree the causes of there being good or bad, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1110,having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1111,"to hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1112,offence and defence which belong to each of them.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1113,We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1114,"foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1115,"ruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1116,"composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1117,"laws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1118,well armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1119,discussion and shall speak of the arms.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1120,"I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1121,"are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1122,Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1123,"his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1124,"they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1125,"valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1126,"fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1127,"long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1128,"by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1129,"keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1130,make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1131,"soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1132,themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1133,"to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1134,"resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1135,"formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1136,when the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1137,"Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1138,hand;[1] and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1139,"truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1140,"related. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1141,have also suffered the penalty.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1142," [1] “With chalk in hand,” “col gesso.” This is one of the bons mots"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1143," of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with which Charles VIII seized"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1144," Italy, implying that it was only necessary for him to send his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1145, quartermasters to chalk up the billets for his soldiers to conquer the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1146," country. Cf. “The History of Henry VII,” by Lord Bacon: “King"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1147," Charles had conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1148, kind of a felicity of a dream. He passed the whole length of Italy
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1149, without resistance: so that it was true what Pope Alexander was wont
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1150," to say: That the Frenchmen came into Italy with chalk in their hands,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1151," to mark up their lodgings, rather than with swords to fight.”"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1152,I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1153,"mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1154,"you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1155,"greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1156,"contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1157,ruined in the usual way.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1158,"And if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1159,"whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1160,"to, either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1161,person and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1162,"citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1163,"ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1164,that he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1165,"and republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1166,mercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1167,"bring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1168,citizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1169,Sparta stood for many ages armed and free. The Switzers are completely
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1170,armed and quite free.

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1172,were oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1176,liberty.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1177,"Duke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1178,"the Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio,[2]"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1179,"allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1182,"of the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom. And if the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1183,Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1185,"defended them, I reply that the Florentines in this case have been"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1186,"favoured by chance, for of the able captains, of whom they might have"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1187,"stood in fear, some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1188,others have turned their ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1189,"was Giovanni Acuto,[4] and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1190,"be proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1191,Florentines would have stood at his discretion. Sforza had the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1192,"Bracceschi always against him, so they watched each other. Francesco"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1193,turned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church and the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1194,kingdom of Naples. But let us come to that which happened a short while

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1196,"prudent man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1197,"renown. If this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1198,"been proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1199,"the soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting, and if"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1200,"they held to him they must obey him. The Venetians, if their"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1202,"gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1203,gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was before they turned
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1204,"to enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1205,forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And in the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1207,"territory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much to"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,reference,NA,CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1677, [1] “The present chapter has given greater offence than any other
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1678," portion of Machiavelli’s writings.” Burd, “Il Principe,” p. 297."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1679,"Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1680,to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1681,has been that those princes who have done great things have held good
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1682,"faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1683,"of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1684,"their word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,[2] the one"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1685,"by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1686,"second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1687,it is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1688,necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1689,and the man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1690,"writers, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1691,"given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1692,"discipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1693,"was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1694,"how to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1695,"durable. A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1696,"beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1697,defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1698,"wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1699,and a lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1700,"not understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1701,"ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1702,and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1703,"men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1704,"are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1705,observe it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1706,legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1707,"modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1708,engagements have been made void and of no effect through the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1709,faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1710,fox has succeeded best.

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1712, that this passage is imitated directly from Cicero’s “De Officiis”:
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1713," “Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi, unum per disceptationem, alterum"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1718,"so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1719,always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1720,example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did nothing
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1721,"else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1722,always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1723,"in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1724,observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1855,the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1857,"Bologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1865, ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli’s strong condemnation of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1866, conspiracies may get its edge from his own very recent experience

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1868, alleged complicity in the Boscoli conspiracy.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1869,For this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1870,of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1872,everything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1874,"the people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1875,important objects a prince can have.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1876,"Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1877,and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1878,and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1879,"authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1880,"the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1881,"would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1882,"hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1883,"protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1884,"of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1885,"liable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1886,"for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1887,could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1888,"king. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1889,a greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1890,"draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1891,"of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1892,"their own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1893,"the nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1894,"It may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1895,of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1896,"my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1897,"qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1898,"been killed by subjects who have conspired against them. Wishing,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1899,"therefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1900,"some of the emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1901,not different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1902,submit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1903,studies the affairs of those times.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1904,It seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1905,the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1906,"Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1907,"Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1908,"There is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1909,ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1910,"contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1911,"put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1912,beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1913,thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1914,"people loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1915,"prince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1916,"cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1917,"exercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1918,vent to their own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1919,"were always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1920,"authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1921,"principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1922,"were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1923,"injuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1924,"cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1925,"avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1926,ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1927,"most powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1928,need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1996,because his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1997,the people might have conceived against him for his violence.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,1998,"But his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2047,discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2048,difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2049,"less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2050,"indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2051,"are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2052,the armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2053,"to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2054,"necessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2055,"the people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2056,powerful.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2057,"From the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2058,twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2059,"the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2060,"putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2061,his friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2062,"the hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2063,"people, he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2064,"of the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2065,"it is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2066,hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2067,"prince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2068,"those who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And this"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2069,"being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2070,because there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2071,"new ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2072,"is old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2074,"But returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2075,consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2076,"fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2077,"it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number in"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2079,unhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2081,heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2082,"destructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2086,"those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2100,"when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2101,"arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2102,"become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2103,subjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2104,"armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2105,"handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2106,"quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2107,considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2108,"service should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2109,"them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2113,already shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2114,to defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2115,"Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2116,always distributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2117,"prince acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2118,"one, then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2119,"who have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2120,"and opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2121,should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2122,shall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2123,"3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2124,to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2125,fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2126,tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily. This
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2127,may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2128,"balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2129,"to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use;"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2130,rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2131,"cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2132,assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist. The
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2133,"Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2134,Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2135,"they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2136,"disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2137,"differences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2138,"afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2139,"party at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2140,"therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2141,permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2143,if war comes this policy proves fallacious.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2144,4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2145,"difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2146,"fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2147,"has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2148,"enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2149,"have the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2150,as by a ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2151,"consider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2152,"craft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2156,distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2157,"Petrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2158,distrusted than by others. But on this question one cannot speak
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2159,"generally, for it varies so much with the individual; I will only say"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2160,"this, that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2161,"hostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2162,"themselves, can always be gained over with the greatest ease, and they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2163,"will be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2164,they know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2165,impression which he had formed of them; and thus the prince always
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2166,"extracts more profit from them than from those who, serving him in too"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2167,"much security, may neglect his affairs. And since the matter demands"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2168,"it, I must not fail to warn a prince, who by means of secret favours"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2169,"has acquired a new state, that he must well consider the reasons which"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2170,induced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a natural
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2171,"affection towards him, but only discontent with their government, then"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2172,"he will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2173,it will be impossible to satisfy them. And weighing well the reasons

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2175,"affairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2176,"of those men who were contented under the former government, and are"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2177,"therefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented with it,"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2179,"6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2180,"more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2181,"to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2182,refuge from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2184,our times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2187,"razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2188,considered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2189,"Bentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2190,"therefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2191,good in one way they injure you in another. And this question can be
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2192,reasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2193,"from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2194,from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone. The
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2195,"castle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2196,more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2197,state. For this reason the best possible fortress is—not to be hated by
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2198,"the people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2199,"will not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2200,wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2201,It has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2202,"to any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli,[1] when the Count"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2203,"Girolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2204,"withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2205,thus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2206,time that the foreigners could not assist the people. But fortresses
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2207,"were of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2208,"and when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners. Therefore,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2209,"it would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2210,been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses. All these
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2211,"things considered then, I shall praise him who builds fortresses as"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2212,"well as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, trusting in them,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2213,cares little about being hated by the people.

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2224,"present King of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2225,"has risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2226,the foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2227,you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2228,"beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2229,foundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2230,"any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2231,occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations;
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2232,thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2233,and authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2234,"of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2235,foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2236,"Further, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2353,which he made was in choosing them.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2354,There were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2356,be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because there
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2357,are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself;
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2358,another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2360,"is the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2361,"Therefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2362,"first rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2368,test which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2393,Therefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2524,"of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2526,prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. I
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2527,believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2528,"according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2529,"accord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2531,"glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2532,"another with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2533,another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2534,a different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2535,"his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2536,"observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2537,impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2538,conform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This follows from
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2539,"what I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2667,"necessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2672,"relied upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2673,and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2674,"close combat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2678,"the battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2685,which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2845,Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situated on the shore of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2846,"the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2847,"goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2848,of which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2849,is distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2850,and from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2851,a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2852,"Fano, facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2853,"for a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2854,which passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2856,which crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2857,"leads into Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2858,this gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2876,when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2877,the duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2878,"recommended his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2879,"nephews that it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2880,"their fathers that should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2881,"before the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2882,with goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2884,"But the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2885,"in Sinigalia, was missing—for Oliverotto was waiting in the square"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2887,"drilling them—signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2889,Oliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2892,and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2894,"came before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2895,"Oliverotto, having made his obeisance, joined the others."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2896,"So the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke’s"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2910,the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into a

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2912,keeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2929,who these persons may have been because they are well known to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2930,"everybody, and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2931,"those who read them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2932,beginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2933,"the world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2934,she begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2935,their career: thus all success must be attributed to her. Castruccio
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2936,"Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds, if he is"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2937,measured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2938,"born; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2939,"in his birth, as the course of this history will show. It appeared to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2940,"be desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in him such"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2941,indications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2942,to men. I think also that I ought to call your attention to his
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2943,"actions, because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2944,The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2945,"of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2946,"estate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2947,"son Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2948,and for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2949,"had an only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2950,"Buonaccorso dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2951,went to live with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2952,"house where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2953,"any person could have access to it without difficulty. One morning,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2954,"shortly after sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2955,"was called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2956,"herbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2957,"leaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2958,something resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2959,"it, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2960,leaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2961,"partly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2962,"to the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2963,"customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2964,he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2965,or compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2966,"what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2967,"children, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2968,"it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2969,"baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2970,"the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2971,"wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2972,lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2973,"to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2974,"canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2975,this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2976,was quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2977,the age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2978,Messer Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2979,"off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2980,"delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2981,"running, leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2982,"far excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2983,"any time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which told of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2984,wars and the mighty deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2985,vexation and sorrow.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2986,"There lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2987,"named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2988,"bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2989,"often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2990,Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2991,resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2992,"mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2993,"top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2994,had often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2995,in those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2996,"excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2997,"authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2998,Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,2999,informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3000,a greater desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3001,day and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3002,"a gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3003,"the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3004,services of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3005,"Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3006,"stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3007,"Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3008,nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3009,"take up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3010,"in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3011,"driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3012,that he would not be able to hold him much longer.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3013,Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3014,"the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3015,astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3016,virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3017,"gentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3018,"could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3019,"tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3020,and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3021,"enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3022,modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3023,"others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3024,"equals, and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3025,"not only by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3026,"had reached his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3027,"by the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3028,"the Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3029,Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3030,"expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3031,"his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3032,Lombardy.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3033,"Castruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation than he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3034,"left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3035,"friends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3036,"for that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3037,"thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3038,be his son’s tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3039,"Francesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3040,"goodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3041,the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3042,"father. Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3043,"tutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3044,created a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3045,"former universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3046,tyrannical intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3047,"Opizi, the head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3048,"Messer Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3049,"that Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3050,"holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity;"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3051,therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3052,"his eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3053,"afterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3054,to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3055,and have him driven out of Lucca.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3056,"The Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3057,who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3058,"their lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3059,with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3060,their restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3061,into his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3062,"the Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3063,"cautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3064,"and munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3065,days in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3066,"with Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3067,"Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3068,Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3069,"portcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3070,the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3071,"entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3072,Giorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3073,"governor was driven out, and the government reformed according to the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3074,"wishes of Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3075,that more than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3076,"who fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3077,"headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3078,hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3079,As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3080,"that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3081,determined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3082,"large army in the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3083,"they marched to Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3084,"Lucca. Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3085,"with a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3086,"against the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3087,"enemy withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3088,Montecatini and Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3089,"Montecarlo, and within about two miles of the enemy, and slight"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3090,skirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3091,"Owing to the illness of Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3092,"coming to battle with the enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3093,"worse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3094,in the hands of Castruccio. This change brought about the ruin of the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3096,"had lost its head, grew over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3097,allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief; he also
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3098,"showed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions of the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3099,"camp to be used. On the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3100,"more they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they drew out in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3101,"the order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio. Presently,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3102,"deeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3103,"their tactics, he decided to join battle with them. First he spoke a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3104,"few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3105,certainty of victory if they would but obey his commands. Castruccio
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3106,had noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3107,"of the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3108,"army; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3109,"men on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3110,"moved to the centre. Observing this order of battle, he drew out of his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3111,"lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3112,come in their insolence to defy him. He then commanded his centre
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3113,"squadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3114,"wings. Thus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3115,"of the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3116,"out of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3117,separated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3118,each other. By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio’s men
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3119,"were opposed to the weaker part of the enemy’s troops, and the most"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3120,efficient men of the enemy were disengaged; and thus the Florentines
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3121,"were unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them, or"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3122,"to give any assistance to their own flanks. So, without much"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3123,"difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks, and the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3124,centre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3125,"attack, without having a chance of displaying their valour. The defeat"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3126,"was complete, and the loss in men very heavy, there being more than ten"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3127,thousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3128,"in Tuscany, and also many princes who had come to help them, among whom"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3129,"were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and Carlo, his nephew, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3130,"Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of Castruccio the loss did"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3131,"not amount to more than three hundred men, among whom was Francesco,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3132,"the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was killed in the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3133,first onset.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3134,This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3135,"Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3136,appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3137,"power, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3138,waited for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3139,"death of Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3140,"Lucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3141,"On the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3142,"driven off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3143,"to the knowledge of Uguccione, who was then at Pisa, it appeared to him"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3144,a proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3145,"son Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3146,"Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3147,"fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3148,"entertained at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3149,"to put him to death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3150,in order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3151,"Ugucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3152,set out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3153,business in his own way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3154,Pisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3155,della Gherardesca their lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3156,"of the occurrences at Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3157,"back, lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them should"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3158,"close their gates against him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3159,"had happened at Pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to demand"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3160,"the liberation of Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3161,arrived in their city. They first began to speak of it in private
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3162,"circles, afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3163,"a tumult, and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3164,"that Castruccio should be set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3165,"might happen, released him from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3166,"his friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3167,"Uguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3168,"with his friends to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where he died in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3169,poverty.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3170,"But Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3171,and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3172,that they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3173,"obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3174,recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3175,"Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3176,"a treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3177,"a fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3178,of two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3179,"at that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3180,short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3181,"pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3182,"wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3183,"lord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3184,"by the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3185,"longer to defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3186,"of Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3187,"Francesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3188,corrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3189,"prince by the people. At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3190,"the Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3191,"Castruccio, in order that he might make friends with him, met him at"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3192,the head of five hundred horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3193,"Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because of the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3194,people’s love for the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3195,"great honour by Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3196,and he was appointed the emperor’s lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3197,"the Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3198,"driven out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3199,"Frederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3200,"of the Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3201,constrained to accept him as their lord.

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3205,"for help and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3207,"exiles were Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3208,"and Piero Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3209,Castruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3210,Tuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces; and in order to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3211,"gain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3212,"Matteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3213,"of his city and the country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3214,"divided his own country districts into five parts, which he supplied"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3215,"with arms, and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns, so that he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3216,"could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers, without"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3217,those whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa. While he
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3218,"surrounded himself with these forces and allies, it happened at Messer"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3219,"Matteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3221,King Ruberto. Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3222,"Florentines in their own territories, so that, being attacked at home,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3223,they should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3224,"defend themselves. Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3225,"Fucecchio and San Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the country."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3226,"Whereupon the Florentines recalled their army, which had scarcely"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3229,"There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3231,him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3232,"received such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3233,other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3234,"found their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3235,upon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3236,"killed him. They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3237,"di Poggio, a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3238,intervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms;
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3239,and he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3240,what they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3241,"intelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3242,"news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3243,"command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3244,"Contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3245,posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3246,it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3247,"him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3248,"for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3249,"pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3250,"former friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3251,"their house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3252,"Stefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3253,to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3254,hear of its inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3255,"him, saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3256,showing his clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3258,into prison and put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3259,"San Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3260,as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3261,"leave him. He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce,"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3263,desirous of getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3264,"with them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3265,"conquests they had made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3266,"turned his attention to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3267,"not again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped, he,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3268,"under various pretences and reasons, first wiped out all those who by"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3269,their ambition might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3270,"them, but depriving them of country and property, and those whom he had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3271,"in his hands of life also, stating that he had found by experience that"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3272,none of them were to be trusted. Then for his further security he
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3273,raised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3274,he had killed or hunted out of the state.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3275,"Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3276,"position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3277,increasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3278,"could get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3279,"which was his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3280,"with the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3281,"parties confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3282,"always had been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3283,"Bianchi was Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3284,"of these men held secret communications with Castruccio, and each"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3285,"desired to drive the other out of the city; and, after many"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3286,"threatenings, they came to blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3287,"Florentine gate, Bastiano at that of the Lucchese side of the city;"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3288,"both trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines, because they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3289,believed that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3290,"the Florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance. He gave"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3291,"promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3292,"to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi. At the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3293,"appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3294,"direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3295,"both were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders entered, and at a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3296,"signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and the other"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3297,"Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed the partisans"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3298,of either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3299,"hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to leave the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3300,"palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him, making them"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3301,many promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside flocked to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3302,"the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3303,"quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3304,valour.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3305,"About this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3306,of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3307,"The German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened—murders"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3308,"and tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3309,an end to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3310,"call in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3311,"the city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3312,"could apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3313,"only to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3314,Castruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3315,"emperor this service, because he believed that he himself would not be"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3316,safe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3317,"Guinigi in command at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3318,"hundred horsemen, where he was received by Enrico with the greatest"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3319,distinction. In a short time the presence of Castruccio obtained such
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3320,"respect for the emperor that, without bloodshed or violence, good order"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3321,"was restored, chiefly by reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3322,"the country round Pisa large quantities of corn, and thus removed the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3323,"source of the trouble. When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3324,"and admonished others, voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3325,"Castruccio received many honours, and was made a Roman senator. This"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3326,"dignity was assumed with the greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3327,"a brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on its"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3328,front: “I am what God wills.” Whilst on the back was: “What God desires
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3329,shall be.”
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3330,"During this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3331,"should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3332,"tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3333,difficult in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3334,"Baldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3335,"danger. These men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3336,"and with the aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3337,"after driving out some of Castruccio’s officials and partisans, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3338,"killing others, they restored the city to its freedom. The news of this"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3339,"greatly angered Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3340,"in great haste to Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3341,"knowing that he would lose no time, they decided to intercept him with"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3342,"their forces in the Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3343,they would cut off his road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3344,"supporters of the Guelph cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3345,"territories. On the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3346,"army; and having heard where the Florentines’ lay, he decided not to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3347,"encounter it in the plains of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3348,"Pescia, but, as far as he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3349,"Pass of Serravalle. He believed that if he succeeded in this design,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3350,"victory was assured, although he was informed that the Florentines had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3351,"thirty thousand men, whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3352,"had every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his troops,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3353,yet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3354,overwhelmed by numbers. Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3355,"Pistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3356,"exact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3357,"narrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3358,"narrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3359,twenty men side by side could hold it. The lord of Serravalle was
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3360,"Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3361,"been allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being common to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3362,"the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either—neither of them"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3363,wishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3364,"neutrality, and came under obligations to no one. For these reasons,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3365,"and also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3366,to maintain his position. It was here that Castruccio had determined to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3367,"fall upon his enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3368,"there was no fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3369,"before they became engaged, they should not stand. As soon as this"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3370,"trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3371,"possession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3372,"friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3373,him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3374,"the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the castellan put"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3375,to death.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3376,"Castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3377,Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3378,"from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3379,army from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3380,"reached their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3381,"on the following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3382,"castle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3383,"from thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3384,Serravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3385,hill at the same time in the morning. Castruccio sent forward his
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3386,"infantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3387,path on the left towards the castle. The Florentines sent forward four
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3388,"hundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following, never"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3389,"expecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill, nor were they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3390,aware of his having seized the castle. Thus it happened that the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3391,Florentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3392,"when they discovered the infantry of Castruccio, and so close were they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3393,upon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors. It was a case
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3394,"of unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were assailed"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3395,"with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3396,although some few of them got through. When the noise of the fighting
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3397,"reached the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion. The"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3398,cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3399,"unable to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3400,"narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3401,to be done or what could be done. In a short time the cavalry who were
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3402,engaged with the enemy’s infantry were scattered or killed without
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3403,having made any effective defence because of their unfortunate
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3404,"position, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3405,"resistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on both"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3406,"flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3407,friends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3408,"decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3409,"infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3410,"horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3411,force to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3412,"out with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3413,"but gave way, and were soon in full retreat—conquered more by their"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3414,unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3415,"rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each man"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3416,seeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3417,"sanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3418,"dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3419,"Florentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3420,"the Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3421,Guelphs. Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3422,"the friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3424,"sides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3425,"about two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3426,"spoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3427,"horse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3428,commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3432,and Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3433,"anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3434,"to King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3435,"he, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3436,"cause was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3437,"receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3438,he sent his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3440,"pressure of Castruccio’s army, owing to his being compelled to leave"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3441,"his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3442,"conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3443,"one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3444,should be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3445,"conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3446,"Castruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3447,"paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3448,"are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3449,Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3450,This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3451,"Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3452,their banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3453,"him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3454,families into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3455,Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3456,"energy upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3457,"their opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3458,"Carlo, the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3459,"to lose no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3460,thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry—having called to their aid
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3461,every Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3462,"attack Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3463,"march on the latter—a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3464,"likely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3465,that the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3466,"In the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3467,"and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3468,thence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3469,"which the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3470,"alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3471,"deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3472,"think that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3473,"of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3474,"foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3475,"Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3476,infantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3477,"Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3478,Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3479,"Moreover, the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3480,"divided their forces, nor could they approach it either from the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3481,"direction of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3482,attack Castruccio’s forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3483,"would find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3484,"own command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3485,"would have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3486,an undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3487,"take this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3488,"the river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3489,expanse of land between them and the river.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3490,"The Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3491,"decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3492,"having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3493,"latter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3494,the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3495,"saddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3496,Florentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3497,"cavalry and ten thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3498,"fixed, and who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3499,"with five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3500,them to issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3501,"thousand light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3502,Arno. The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3503,arms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3504,"river, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3505,"difficult for the others, by reason of the few who had crossed having"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3506,"broken up the bed of the river, and this being deep with mud, many of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3507,the horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3508,fast that they could not move. When the Florentine captains saw the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3509,"difficulties their men were meeting, they withdrew them and moved"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3510,"higher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3511,the banks more adapted for landing. These men were met at the bank by
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3512,"the forces which Castruccio had already sent forward, who, being light"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3513,"armed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3514,"tremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry. The horses,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3515,"alarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3516,trampled each other in great confusion. The fight between the men of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3517,Castruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3518,and terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3519,would yield. The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3520,"into the river, whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3521,"in order to make room for the others pressing forward, who if they"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3522,"could but get out of the water would be able to fight, and in this"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3523,obstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains. Castruccio
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3524,shouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3525,"before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florentines reproached each"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3526,other that the many should be overcome by the few. At length
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3527,"Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted, and that both his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3528,"men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had many"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3529,"killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of infantry to take up"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3530,a position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3531,"these latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3532,one part of them to turn to the right and another to the left. This
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3533,"cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3534,thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield. But when these
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3535,tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio’s
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3536,reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3537,the river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3538,"decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3539,"inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3540,"defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3541,when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3542,"of the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3543,Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3544,of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3545,"lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3546,enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3547,"captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3548,"crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3549,"down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio’s army. But"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3550,"here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3551,"Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3552,were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3553,"escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3554,"were taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3555,"Michelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3556,"commissioners, fled to Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3557,"was infinitely greater, as might be expected in such a battle. Of the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3558,"Florentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3559,whilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3560,But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3561,"life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3562,ruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3563,"into effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3564,death could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3565,"the whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3566,"and overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3567,their return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3568,watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day;
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3569,he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3570,the first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3571,stood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3572,"Arno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3573,"which he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3574,was the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3575,"high fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3576,"prove fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3577,addressed him as follows:
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3578,“If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3582,because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3584,Florentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3585,"peoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3586,"more peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3587,"one more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3588,"insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3589,"with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3590,"to surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3594,born of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3600,"father left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3601,"I have never married, so that the love of children should never deflect"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3602,my mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3603,"Thus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3604,"deeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure."
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3605,"Thou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3606,"contented under thy government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3608,"sometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3611,recently inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3615,"princes of Milan thou canst place no reliance, for they are far"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3616,"distant, slow, and their help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3617,"hast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities, and in the memory"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3618,"of my valour, and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3619,"thee; which, as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3620,"thee to come to terms with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3621,"under this great defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And"

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3625,thee advantages and security. It is of the greatest important in this

1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3627,strength and means; and he who knows that he has not a genius for
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3628,fighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace. And it will be
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3629,"well for thee to rule thy conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3630,way to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and in this
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3631,thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3632,"have told thee is true. And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3633,I have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.”
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3634,"After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3635,"and Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3636,"Pagolo to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3637,"successor, he died. He left a happy memory to those who had known him,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3638,and no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3639,"was. His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3640,was buried in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3641,"Pagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3642,"abilities. Not long after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3643,"and then Pistoia, and only with difficulty held on to Lucca. This"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3644,latter city continued in the family of Guinigi until the time of the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3645,great-grandson of Pagolo.
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3646,From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3647,"man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3648,but also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3649,"ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3650,"presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3651,"with him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3652,"and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3653,"snowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3654,but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3655,"with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3656,"desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3657,"that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3658,"bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3659,was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3660,"nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3661,that the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3662,sharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3663,"for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3664,angered with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3665,"he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3666,the following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3667,"partridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3668,Castruccio had said: “You would not have given more than a penny.”
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3669,"“That is true,” answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: “A"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3670,ducat is much less to me.” Having about him a flatterer on whom he had
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3671,"spat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: “Fisherman"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3672,are willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3673,"they may take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3674,spittle that I may catch a whale”; and this was not only heard by
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3675,Castruccio with patience but rewarded. When told by a priest that it
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3676,"was wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: “If that be"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3677,a vice then you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3678,saints.” Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3679,"a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him:"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3680,"“Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3681,into such places.” A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3682,"and was told: “Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3683,gave so much trouble to fasten.” Castruccio said to one who professed
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3684,to be a philosopher: “You are like the dogs who always run after those
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3685,"who will give them the best to eat,” and was answered: “We are rather"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3686,like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3687,"need of them.” Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3688,"disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3689,"cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3690,"anything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3691,every man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked by one
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3692,"what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: “When thou goest to a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3693,banquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3694,"another.” To a person who was boasting that he had read many things,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3695,Castruccio said: “He knows better than to boast of remembering many
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3696,things.” Someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3697,intoxicated. Castruccio replied: “An ox does the same.” Castruccio was
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3698,"acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3699,blamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3700,"taken in by a woman, he said: “She has not taken me in, I have taken"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3701,"her.” Being also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered:"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3702,"“Thou dost not spend as much as I do?” and being told that it was true,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3703,he continued: “Then thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous.”
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3704,"Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and splendid citizen of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3705,"Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3706,chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3707,and foliage of the most beautiful colouring. Castruccio gathered some
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3708,"saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo, and seeing him much"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3709,"disturbed by this, said to him: “I knew not where to spit in order to"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3710,offend thee less.” Being asked how Caesar died he said: “God willing I
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3711,will die as he did.” Being one night in the house of one of his
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3712,"gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was reproved by one of"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3713,his friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3714,"usual in one of his station, so he said: “He who is considered wise by"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3715,day will not be considered a fool at night.” A person came to demand a
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3716,"favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3717,"threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3718,"Castruccio, said: “Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3719,"thy ears in thy feet,” whereupon he obtained double the favour he had"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3720,"asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3721,seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3722,blindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3723,"words, he said to him: “When you have another request to make, send"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3724,someone else to make it.” Having been wearied by a similar man with a
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3725,long oration who wound up by saying: “Perhaps I have fatigued you by
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3726,"speaking so long,” Castruccio said: “You have not, because I have not"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3727,listened to a word you said.” He used to say of one who had been a
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3728,"beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3729,"dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3730,"took the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3731,said: “Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3732,unfortunate?” Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3733,"Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: “What shall I give you if"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3734,you will let me give you a blow on the nose?” Castruccio answered: “A
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3735,helmet.” Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3736,"instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3737,"wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3738,themselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3739,"those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3740,"that they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3741,when the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3742,that whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3743,"to learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3744,only looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3745,"be buried when he died, and answered: “With the face turned downwards,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3746,for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.” On
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3747,being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3748,"to save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3749,strange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3750,della Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3751,"to preserve his health, and replied: “If the man be rich let him eat"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3752,"when he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.” Seeing one of his"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3753,"gentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: “I"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3754,pray God that you will let him feed you also.” Seeing that someone had
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3755,written upon his house in Latin the words: “May God preserve this house
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3756,"from the wicked,” he said, “The owner must never go in.” Passing"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3757,"through one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3758,and remarked: “That house will fly through the door.” He was having a
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3759,discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3760,"property of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them,"
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3761,and the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. “Is this
1232,The Prince,The Prince,1532,Niccolò Machiavelli,contents,content,3762,"king of yours a bad man or a good one?” asked Castruccio, and was told"
