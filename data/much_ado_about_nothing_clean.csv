1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,LEONATO,2,to Messina.
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,3,He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left him.
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,LEONATO,4,How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,5,"But few of any sort, and none of name."
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,LEONATO,6,A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,LEONATO,7,numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,LEONATO,8,young Florentine called Claudio.
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,9,"Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro."

1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,11,of a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better bettered expectation
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,12,than you must expect of me to tell you how.
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,LEONATO,13,He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.

1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,LEONATO,17,Did he break out into tears?
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,18,In great measure.
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,LEONATO,19,A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,LEONATO,20,that are so washed; how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at

1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,27,"O! he is returned, and as pleasant as ever he was."
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,28,He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the

1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,37,valiant trencher-man; he hath an excellent stomach.
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,38,"And a good soldier too, lady."
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,39,And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,40,"A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all honourable"
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,41,virtues.
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,42,It is so indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man; but for the
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,43,"stuffing,—well, we are all mortal."
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,LEONATO,44,"You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war"
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,LEONATO,45,betwixt Signior Benedick and her; they never meet but there’s a
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,LEONATO,46,skirmish of wit between them.
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,47,Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,48,"five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one! so"
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,49,"that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a"
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,50,difference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,51,hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,52,hath every month a new sworn brother.
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,53,Is’t possible?
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,54,Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as the fashion of
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,55,his hat; it ever changes with the next block.
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,56,"I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books."
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,57,"No; and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is"
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,58,his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,BEATRICE,59,him to the devil?
1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT I,SCENE I,MESSENGER,60,He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.

1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT II,SCENE III,BENEDICK,834,seem to pity the lady: it seems her affections have their full bent. Love

1519,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,William Shakespeare,contents,dialogue,ACT II,SCENE III,BENEDICK,837,that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never
