12242,"Poems by Emily Dickinson",1890,"Emily Dickinson","front_matter",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"forfeit whatever advantage lies in the discipline of public criticism"
12242,"Poems by Emily Dickinson",1890,"Emily Dickinson","front_matter",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"and the enforced conformity to accepted ways. On the other hand, it"

12242,"Poems by Emily Dickinson",1890,"Emily Dickinson","front_matter",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"conventional rules, had yet a rigorous literary standard of her own,"
12242,"Poems by Emily Dickinson",1890,"Emily Dickinson","front_matter",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"and often altered a word many times to suit an ear which had its own"
