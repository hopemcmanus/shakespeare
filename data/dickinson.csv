"15",12242,"PREFACE."
"16",12242,""
"17",12242,"The verses of Emily Dickinson belong emphatically to what Emerson"
"18",12242,"long since called ""the Poetry of the Portfolio,""--something produced"
"19",12242,"absolutely without the thought of publication, and solely by way of"
"20",12242,"expression of the writer's own mind. Such verse must inevitably"
"21",12242,"forfeit whatever advantage lies in the discipline of public criticism"
"22",12242,"and the enforced conformity to accepted ways. On the other hand, it"
"23",12242,"may often gain something through the habit of freedom and the"
"24",12242,"unconventional utterance of daring thoughts. In the case of the"
"25",12242,"present author, there was absolutely no choice in the matter; she"
"26",12242,"must write thus, or not at all. A recluse by temperament and habit,"
"27",12242,"literally spending years without setting her foot beyond the"
"28",12242,"doorstep, and many more years during which her walks were strictly"
"29",12242,"limited to her father's grounds, she habitually concealed her mind,"
"30",12242,"like her person, from all but a very few friends; and it was with"
"31",12242,"great difficulty that she was persuaded to print, during her"
"32",12242,"lifetime, three or four poems.  Yet she wrote verses in great"
"33",12242,"abundance; and though brought curiously indifferent to all"
"34",12242,"conventional rules, had yet a rigorous literary standard of her own,"
"35",12242,"and often altered a word many times to suit an ear which had its own"
"36",12242,"tenacious fastidiousness."
"37",12242,""
"38",12242,"Miss Dickinson was born in Amherst, Mass., Dec. 10, 1830, and died"
"39",12242,"there May 15, 1886. Her father, Hon. Edward Dickinson, was the"
"40",12242,"leading lawyer of Amherst, and was treasurer of the well-known"
"41",12242,"college there situated. It was his custom once a year to hold a large"
"42",12242,"reception at his house, attended by all the families connected with"
"43",12242,"the institution and by the leading people of the town. On these"
"44",12242,"occasions his daughter Emily emerged from her wonted retirement and"
"45",12242,"did her part as gracious hostess; nor would any one have known from"
"46",12242,"her manner, I have been told, that this was not a daily occurrence."
"47",12242,"The annual occasion once past, she withdrew again into her seclusion,"
"48",12242,"and except for a very few friends was as invisible to the world as if"
"49",12242,"she had dwelt in a nunnery.  For myself, although I had corresponded"
"50",12242,"with her for many years, I saw her but twice face to face, and"
"51",12242,"brought away the impression of something as unique and remote as"
"52",12242,"Undine or Mignon or Thekla."
"53",12242,""
"54",12242,"This selection from her poems is published to meet the desire of her"
"55",12242,"personal friends, and especially of her surviving sister. It is"
"56",12242,"believed that the thoughtful reader will find in these pages a"
"57",12242,"quality more suggestive of the poetry of William Blake than of"
"58",12242,"anything to be elsewhere found,--flashes of wholly original and"
"59",12242,"profound insight into nature and life; words and phrases exhibiting"
"60",12242,"an extraordinary vividness of descriptive and imaginative power, yet"
"61",12242,"often set in a seemingly whimsical or even rugged frame. They are"
"62",12242,"here published as they were written, with very few and superficial"
"63",12242,"changes; although it is fair to say that the titles have been"
"64",12242,"assigned, almost invariably, by the editors. In many cases these"
"65",12242,"verses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots, with"
"66",12242,"rain and dew and earth still clinging to them, giving a freshness and"
"67",12242,"a fragrance not otherwise to be conveyed.  In other cases, as in the"
"68",12242,"few poems of shipwreck or of mental conflict, we can only wonder at"
"69",12242,"the gift of vivid imagination by which this recluse woman can"
"70",12242,"delineate, by a few touches, the very crises of physical or mental"
"71",12242,"struggle. And sometimes again we catch glimpses of a lyric strain,"
"72",12242,"sustained perhaps but for a line or two at a time, and making the"
"73",12242,"reader regret its sudden cessation. But the main quality of these"
"74",12242,"poems is that of extraordinary grasp and insight, uttered with an"
"75",12242,"uneven vigor sometimes exasperating, seemingly wayward, but really"
"76",12242,"unsought and inevitable.  After all, when a thought takes one's"
"77",12242,"breath away, a lesson on grammar seems an impertinence. As Ruskin"
"78",12242,"wrote in his earlier and better days, ""No weight nor mass nor beauty"
"79",12242,"of execution can outweigh one grain or fragment of thought."""

"90",12242,""
"91",12242,"As is well documented, Emily Dickinson's poems were edited in these"
"92",12242,"early editions by her friends, better to fit the conventions of the"
"93",12242,"times. In particular, her dashes, often small enough to appear"
"94",12242,"as dots, became commas and semi-colons."
"95",12242,""
"96",12242,"In the second series of poems published, a facsimile of her"
"97",12242,"handwritten poem which her editors titled ""Renunciation"" is given,"

"2801",12242,""
"2802",12242,"The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's"
"2803",12242,"poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern"
"2804",12242,"artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the"
"2805",12242,"qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest"
"2806",12242,"themes,--life and love and death. That ""irresistible needle-touch,"""
"2807",12242,"as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very"
"2808",12242,"core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as"
"2809",12242,"it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling"
"2810",12242,"power.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to"
"2811",12242,"form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties."
"2812",12242,""
"2813",12242,"Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending"
"2814",12242,"occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of"
"2815",12242,"her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend ""H.H."""
"2816",12242,"must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th"
"2817",12242,"September, 1884, she wrote:--"
"2818",12242,""
"2819",12242,""
"2820",12242,"MY DEAR FRIEND,-- What portfolios full of verses"
"2821",12242,"you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your ""day and"

"2824",12242,"If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive"
"2825",12242,"you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee"
"2826",12242,"and executor. Surely after you are what is called"
"2827",12242,"""dead"" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you"
"2828",12242,"have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your"
"2829",12242,"verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think"
"2830",12242,"we have a right to withhold from the world a word or"
"2831",12242,"a thought any more than a deed which might help a"
"2832",12242,"single soul. . . ."
"2833",12242,""

"2835",12242,""
"2836",12242,"                        HELEN JACKSON."
"2837",12242,""
"2838",12242,""
"2839",12242,"The ""portfolios"" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death,"
"2840",12242,"by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had"
"2841",12242,"been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little"
"2842",12242,"fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear"
"2843",12242,"evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had"
"2844",12242,"received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of"
"2845",12242,"rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and"
"2846",12242,"phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one"
"2847",12242,"form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without"
"2848",12242,"important exception, her friends have generously placed at the"
"2849",12242,"disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and"
"2850",12242,"these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several"
"2851",12242,"renderings of the same verse."
"2852",12242,""
"2853",12242,"To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been"
"2854",12242,"subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They"
"2855",12242,"should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and"
"2856",12242,"suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some"
"2857",12242,"time in the finished picture."
"2858",12242,""
"2859",12242,"Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the"
"2860",12242,"winter of 1862. In a letter to oone of the present Editors the"
"2861",12242,"April following, she says, ""I made no verse, but one or two, until"
"2862",12242,"this winter."""
"2863",12242,""
"2864",12242,"The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running"
"2865",12242,"Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in"
"2866",12242,"breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her"
"2867",12242,"latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its"
"2868",12242,"fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,"
"2869",12242,"everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous"
"2870",12242,"dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of"
"2871",12242,"a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and"
"2872",12242,"strong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of"
"2873",12242,"the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,"
"2874",12242,"the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general"
"2875",12242,"chronologic accuracy."
"2876",12242,""
"2877",12242,"As a rule, the verses were without titles; but ""A Country Burial,"""
"2878",12242,"""A Thunder-Storm,"" ""The Humming-Bird,"" and a few others were named"
"2879",12242,"by their author, frequently at the end,--sometimes only in the"
"2880",12242,"accompanying note, if sent to a friend."
"2881",12242,""
"2882",12242,"The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in"
"2883",12242,"pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of"
"2884",12242,"responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not"
"2885",12242,"absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her"
"2886",12242,"rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it"
"2887",12242,"seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and"
"2888",12242,"more usual rhymes."
"2889",12242,""
"2890",12242,"Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very"
"2891",12242,"absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily"
"2892",12242,"Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a"
"2893",12242,"particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything"
"2894",12242,"virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of"
"2895",12242,"inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and"
"2896",12242,"the ""thought-rhyme"" appears frequently,--appealing, indeed, to an"
"2897",12242,"unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing."
"2898",12242,""
"2899",12242,"Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness."
"2900",12242,"Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the"
"2901",12242,"sombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She"
"2902",12242,"touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost"
"2903",12242,"humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is"
"2904",12242,"never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic"
"2905",12242,"has said, she may exhibit toward God ""an Emersonian self-possession,"""
"2906",12242,"it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced"
"2907",12242,"as it is rare."
"2908",12242,""
"2909",12242,"She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking.  She"
"2910",12242,"was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no"
"2911",12242,"love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature"
"2912",12242,"introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist"
"2913",12242,"in pretence."
"2914",12242,""
"2915",12242,"Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and"
"2916",12242,"bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted"
"2917",12242,"human friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the"
"2918",12242,"first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of"
"2919",12242,"pope; the first red leaf hurrying through ""the altered air,"" an"
"2920",12242,"epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or"
"2921",12242,"melancholy, she lived in its presence."

"6963",12242,""
"6964",12242,"The intellectual activity of Emily Dickinson was so great that"
"6965",12242,"a large and characteristic choice is still possible among her"
"6966",12242,"literary material, and this third volume of her verses is put"
"6967",12242,"forth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of her"
"6968",12242,"peculiar genius. Much of Emily Dickinson's prose was rhythmic,"
"6969",12242,"--even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines."
"6970",12242,""
"6971",12242,"Also many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in"
"6972",12242,"letters; these were published in 1894, in the volumes of her"
"6973",12242,"_Letters_. It has not been necessary, however, to include them in"
"6974",12242,"this Series, and all have been omitted, except three or four"
"6975",12242,"exceptionally strong ones, as ""A Book,"" and ""With Flowers."""
"6976",12242,""
"6977",12242,"There is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply"
"6978",12242,"spontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward"
"6979",12242,"circumstance. Others, however, had an obvious personal origin;"
"6980",12242,"for example, the verses ""I had a Guinea golden,"" which seem to"
"6981",12242,"have been sent to some friend travelling in Europe, as a dainty"
"6982",12242,"reminder of letter-writing delinquencies. The surroundings in"
"6983",12242,"which any of Emily Dickinson's verses are known to have been"
"6984",12242,"written usually serve to explain them clearly; but in general the"
"6985",12242,"present volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation to"
"6986",12242,"those who apprehend this scintillating spirit."
