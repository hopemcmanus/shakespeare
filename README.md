# Shakespeare

This repository contains data on some plays of William Shakespeare.

## Data

The data is scraped from [gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org/), and processed into CSV format. 
The processing code can be found in the `R/cleangutenbergshakespeare.R` file. 
For each work obtained from [gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org/), the Plain Text UTF-8 edition is identified by Project Gutenberg as being in the public domain. The texts reproduced here are based on those editions and therefore retain the same public-domain status.
